# Account - Allow updating tax grids


    This module allows updating tax grids on existing accounting entries.
    In debug mode a button to update your entries' tax grids will be available
    in Accounting settings.
    This is typically useful after some legal changes were done on the tax report,
    requiring a new tax configuration.
