# Debit Notes


In a lot of countries, a debit note is used as an increase of the amounts of an existing invoice 
or in some specific cases to cancel a credit note. 
It is like a regular invoice, but we need to keep track of the link with the original invoice.  
The wizard used is similar as the one for the credit note.
